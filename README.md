<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

astroSpeed was born from the needs of the Astro and Next.js community. These communities highly value performant web pages and speed. Thus, astroSpeed was created as an on-demand tool to generate a local dashboard displaying performance metrics and opportunities.

What do you mean by on-demand?

Typically, developers need to wait for their site to be live/published to see how optimized their site is. This is slow and the infrequency provides low visiblity in ensuring your building towards an optimized product. With astroSpeed, developers are now able to see their site's performance upon every commit. By empowering users to access their metrics on-demand, developers can keep stay up to speed with their code and pivot more quicky when they are aware of unoptimized code.

What kind of performance metrics?

Trusted by __M users, Lighthouse is an open-source tool developed and maintained by Google. Google Lighthouse reports provides powerful metrics to provide insights on how users experience your page and ways to improve your web metrics, including Performance, SEO, Accessibility and Best Practices. astroSpeed combines Lighthouse analytics & diagnotic features them on local dashboard see trends and improvmenets over time.

What do you mean by opportunities?

Suboptimal metrics can be overwhelming if you do not know where to start. astroSpeed users have access to actionable ways to improve their scores. 


Summary

astroSpeed integrates industry-standard performance metrics and actionable recommendations to empower our users to notice deficiencies, improving their page quality and remain agile. Those who know how to design and impliement performant sites reap the benefits of higher user satisifcation, and higher revenue.

Today, astroSpeed works with <i>any</i> server-side rendering framework, giving our users powerful insights and opportunities for importmeents (actionable recommendations/diagnostics) to work towards building the most optimized page possible. The speed it takes for a webpage to load is the #1 important factor for users, let astroSpeed help you get there.
